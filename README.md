# LangChain Router Chain Playground

This simple project shows how you can use *LLMRouterChain* to simulate different roles 
which are selected dynamically during your interaction with the LLM depending on your question.

It also contains a good example of a file based callback handler which you can use to save content to a text or HTML file.
